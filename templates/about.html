        <p>This site tracks new releases of various pieces of software and notifies you about it. Not every place has a mailing list to subscribe
            to for updates and not everyone wants to sign up to a dozen different mailing lists. We're your one stop shop for those notifications.</p>
        <p>I thought a site like this already existed years ago, so I didn't pursue the idea further. When I went back looking for it, I couldn't 
            find it and made my own.
